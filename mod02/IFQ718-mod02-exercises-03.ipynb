    "As in all lines of work, reproducibility is key. This means that your methods should be descriptive enough to allow another person to reproduce the exact results that you achieved. Consider a cake recipe, or an industrial protocol for creating plastics. These methods are not designed from scratch for every flavour of cake or for every type of manufactured plastic - they are simply modified to suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of computing, a method to solve a problem is implemented using a programming language. In our case, Python is the tool, or programming language, that we use to solve the problems presented to us. Assuming the code does not change and the original raw data is still available, then we should have no issue with reproducing our results over and over again. Once we have established our method, we could package it to share with others. That way, they do not need to design and implement a solution to the same or similar problem that we had. To summarise, we do not want others, nor us, to *reinvent the wheel*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, these packaged solutions offer a diverse set of capabilities for the programmer. For example, there exist packages with modules containing mathematical formula for scientific computing, through to modules containing the software systems to deliver websites on the internet. This will be our first time to learn about how we can use the in-built Python Standard Libraries, which each offer an array of extensions to make programming in the language more simple than without them. *Do not reinvent the wheel!*\n",
    "\n",
    "To get you started, let's define what a *module* and a *function* is. We have yet not been explicit in naming/defining these as we have wanted you to learn the absolute-basics before reaching this point, but it would difficult to continue without introducing them now. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with functions, the smallest unit of logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a small, parametised unit of work that is intended to be reused at the programmers desire. Some examples of functions that we have sprinkled throughout the unit so far include: `range()`, `len()` and `print()`. It was difficult to introduce you to Python without these, but now we will formally introduce you.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #ccc\">To be precise, Python is an [interpreted language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)), meaning that these in-built functions are not implemented in Python itself.</span>\n",
