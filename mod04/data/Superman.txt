The Adventures of Superman

Faster than a speeding bullet!
More powerful than a locomotive!
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!
    "Look, up in the sky!"
    "It's a bird!"
    "It's a plane!"
    "It's Superman!!!"
Yes, it's Superman, strange visitor from another planet who
came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of
mortal men.  Superman, who can change the course of mighty
rivers, bend steel in his bare hands, and who - disguised
as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great
Metropolitan newspaper - fights a never-ending battle for
truth, justice and the American way.
