    "It is important that you learn how to inteact with the system using a Bash shell as in data science you will often not have access to a graphical user interface (eg: you may be remotely connecting to a high performance cluster over SSH). Text editors, tools like Excel and file explorers tend to be our go-to tools for interacting and manipulating data, but it can be combersome using those tools as your datasets may be extremely large and they may not handle large input. In todays class, you will learn some basic bash commands. These skills are applicable in areas such as: scripting, interacting with off-site computers over the internet, Unix systems and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the Born Again Shell (Bash) is used in Linux environments. If you are reading this notebook from the QUT Jupyter Lab service then you are inheritently using a Linux system via your web browser, i.e., the server running Jupyter Lab is running Linux as its operating system. If you download this notebook to your Windows PC then you will experience issues with the commands, as they do not exist in Windows.\n",
