    "The [Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) provides a style guide for Python code. This includes the style to be used when naming variables, amongst other aspects of the language that you will learn in later modules.\n",

    "> #### A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds\n",
    "> \n",
    "> One of Guido‚Äôs key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written. The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20 says, ‚ÄúReadability counts‚Äù.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> However, know when to be inconsistent ‚Äì sometimes style guide recommendations just aren‚Äôt applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don‚Äôt hesitate to ask!\n",
    "\n",
    "In PEP 8, many naming styles are acknowledged, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* b (single lowercase letter)\n",
    "* B (single uppercase letter)\n",
    "* lowercase\n",
    "* lower_case_with_underscores\n",
    "* UPPERCASE\n",
    "* UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES\n",
    "* CapitalizedWords (or CapWords, or CamelCase ‚Äì so named because of the bumpy look of its letters). This is also sometimes known as StudlyCaps.\n",

Perhaps, for a sizable portion of us in the class, English is the language that we are most comfortable with, but my prediction is that none of us could use a programming language as a day-to-day language. Further, given the [very few words](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) used in a programming language, we need to explain our Python code using a common language, otherwise it quickly becomes difficult to understand.
